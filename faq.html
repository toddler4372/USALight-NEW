		Prepaying Duty & Taxes / Guaranteed Landed Cost
		</div>
		<div class="support_right">
		During checkout, you will be given the opportunity to prepay your duties and taxes for your order. Doing this allows you to pay for your entire order upon checkout with a guarantee that you won't be charged any VAT, duty, taxes or other shipping or customs related fees after your order is complete. Depending on your country and your order value, your order may already be under the deminimus value (the minimum amount at which local taxes are required). In such cases, no duty or tax fees are assessed.
			<br/><br/>
			<ul style="padding: 0;margin-left: 14px;margin-top: 0;">
				<li style="margin-right: 20px;">Customer is responsible for all fees and taxes - we charge only for our shipping costs.</li>
				<li style="margin-right: 20px;">Customer is responsible for knowing their own laws and for the value of the package should it be confiscated at customs.</li>
				<li style="margin-right: 20px;">If package is found to be undeliverable, customer is responsible for cost of shipping back to us (which can be higher than original shipping).</li>
				<li style="margin-right: 20px;">Return and replacement shipping costs for warranty issues must be paid by the customer.</li>
			</ul>

In order to facilitate the order process, you'll be given several shipping options based on the amount of time the order will take to arrive. Please note that all delivery times are listed in business days (Monday through Friday) so you'll want to take this into consideration when selecting your shipping method.

		<h3>Warranty Information</h3>
		</a>
		<div class="support_left">
		About Warranties
		</div>
		<div class="support_right">
		USALight.com takes customer service very seriously. USALight.com warranties all our products for 1 year for the original purchaser. Any manufacturer warranty that exceeds USALight.com's standard 1-Year Warranty can be resolved with that particular manufacturer by the purchaser.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			The warranty policy at USALight.com is designed to ensure our customers' confidence. Please take a moment to review our policies below.
		</div>
		<div class="support_left">
		Manufacturers Warranties
		</div>
		<div class="support_right">
		Many products offered by USALight.com provide a manufacturer's warranty. Manufacturer warranty contact information is included with these products.
		</div>
		<div class="support_left">
		About Damages
		</div>
		<div class="support_right">
		USALight.com takes great care in packing and shipping items to avoid transit-related damage.  However, in the case that an item is received damaged, claims must be made within two working days of the damage. As the shipper, we will file the claim on the customer's behalf and arrange for replacement at no charge and no shipping, or arrange for refund. The package must be received (not refused under any circumstances) and inspected. Replacement and refund will be assessed according to the amount of the actual damage.
			<br/>
		</div>
		<div class="support_left">
		Replacement Limitations
		</div>
		<div class="support_right">
		If the total amount of the product for replacement for either damage or defective, is less than ten ($10), a refund, rather than a replacement will be offered to the customer. Shipping small one item packages  increases the  chance of damage.  Improper installation of products which cause damage voids any return, and warranty.  Any modifications or improper use of any of our products that is not approved in writing by USALight.com shall void this warranty.  USALight.com highly recommends consulting with a contractor or lighting specialist for applications of our products, and cannot be held liable for damages or injuries sustained from improper use of our products outside of the listed specifications
		</div>
		<div class="support_left">
		Refunds
		</div>
		<div class="support_right">
		According to U.S. law, refund credits can only be returned back to the card of original purchase. In the event that a card can no longer be charged back (lost card etc.) an attempt on our part has to be made at least once and then a company check will be sent to the purchaser.
		</div>
		<div class="support_left">
		Shipping or Website Errors
		</div>
		<div class="support_right">
		Should the customer receive product not expressly ordered either by our shipping error or incorrect website information, the product will be picked up by our shipper and replacements shipped at no additional charge.
		</div>
		<div class="support_left">
		LED / Low Voltage Compatibility
		</div>
		<div class="support_right">
		Compatibility with low-voltage transformers can be an issue with LED MR16 replacement lamps. Transformers generally require a minimum connected load for proper operation of the connected lamps. Compared to the halogen MR16 lamps that they replace, LED versions draw significantly less power (e.g., 3 W vs. 20 W) and may not provide sufficient load to the transformer. Consequently, LED MR16 replacement lamps may not work or may flicker, strobe, or randomly shut down in an existing low-voltage lighting system. Similarly, existing dimmers, relays, and related-controls typically have minimum load requirements and may not operate properly with some LED replacement lamps.
			<br/><br/>Please consult a professional before using LED light bulbs in low voltage fixtures, as this combination will void your USALight.com warranty.
